# Blood donation app
The project is meant to be a local scheduler for a **blood donation center**.
It was created as the project for the **OOP** course.
## Description
The project uses **React** for the _**frontend**_ of the site and **Spring Boot** for the  _**backend**_.
In this repository there is only the backend, the frontend can be found  [here](https://github.com/julien2429/BloodDonationFrontEnd).
For the database I choose **PostgreSQL** as I had prior knowledge in working with it.

## DataBase

The **database** diagram can be seen above. 
The tables and all the connections are generated by **Spring Boot**. Once generated they are only updated from that point forward.

All the repositories expand upon the **JPArepository** class. I used this class because it had a lot of functionalities already implemented.

  

## Further enhancements

 - Deploy the application.
 - Make the solution universal, such that any blood donation center can enroll.
 - Add security measures.
